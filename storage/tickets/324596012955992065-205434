   Bacio001#2484 » 11 minutes ago
       That is just a template for people to use So you can tell them if you need quick help or not

Raise = Only staff with a permission can see the ticket 
Verb = All staff can see it 
Transcript = Get ticket transcript on close of ticket

   Bacio001#2484 » 10 minutes ago
       Just to priorities your ticket or not

   jack.#2021 » 5 minutes ago
       right can you add 2 things then

   jack.#2021 » 4 minutes ago
       1. Pin the top embed as soon as the ticket is opened
2. Make the top embed editable (fully if possible)
3. When you close, repeat those tools such as Re-Open and Transcript and Delete

   jack.#2021 » 4 minutes ago
       That way its easy for my staff members to close, transcript and delete

   jack.#2021 » 4 minutes ago
       or reopen if it was accidental

   Bacio001#2484 » 3 minutes ago
       So I would have to make a archive for that which is possible but rn you can just load the transcript for the ticket

   jack.#2021 » 3 minutes ago
       no not like that

   Bacio001#2484 » 3 minutes ago
       Try closing it and ill show you waht yo ucan do

   jack.#2021 » 3 minutes ago
       i meant like ticket tool

   jack.#2021 » 2 minutes ago
       so when you do -close it will send an embed "Support Team Controls"
- Reopen
- Delete
- Transcript

   jack.#2021 » 2 minutes ago
       Reopen = Add the user back to the ticket
Delete = Remove the channel
Transcript = save to #transcripts

Close command: Remove the user from the channel but keep it open for staff to view

   Bacio001#2484 » 2 minutes ago
       ohhh

   Bacio001#2484 » 1 minute ago
       yeah I can do that so what close is rn should be delete I guess

   Bacio001#2484 » 38 seconds ago
       If you close it rn it deletes the channel but archives the ticket as a txt
